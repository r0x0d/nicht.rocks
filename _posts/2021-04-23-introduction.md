# Welcome, my friend! 

H! Welcome to my personal blog. Here, I will write about my research and discoveries that I find interesting. The following topics may recur here.

- Searches related to OSDev
- Publications related to programming languages: Python, Rust and etc ...
- Reverse engineering (as I learn more about it)
- CTFs
- And much much more!

I hope you like what you see in the next posts and can end up learning with me about the wonders of technology!

Cheers,
Rodolfo Olivieri.
